# Line-Following Autonomous Vehicle

This repository contains the source code for an Arduino-based line-following autonomous vehicle developed for the EEEE1027 module.

## Project Overview
The vehicle uses infrared sensors for line detection, rotary encoders for distance measurement, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and an MPU-6050 inertial measurement unit for motion and ramp detection. Motor control is implemented using an L298N dual H-bridge driver.

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- Infrared line sensors (left, centre, right)
- Rotary encoders
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- MPU-6050 IMU
- L298N motor driver
- DC motors

## Notes
This repository is provided for reference only. The code reflects the final tested implementation used in the project.
